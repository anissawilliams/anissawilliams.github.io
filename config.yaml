  - id: "regulations-pipeline"
    title: "Regulations Pipeline"
    short_description: "Automated pipeline for ingesting, structuring and monitoring regulatory documents at scale."
    long_description: |
      A document-processing pipeline that ingests regulatory text, extracts key entities and relationships,
      and structures the data for downstream compliance analysis. The system maintains a record of each
      document’s last-seen hash and update timestamp, allowing it to automatically detect when a regulation
      has changed. When updates occur, the parser reprocesses the document, flags substantive differences,
      and refreshes the structured output. Built with reproducibility, monitoring, and large-scale ingestion
      in mind.
